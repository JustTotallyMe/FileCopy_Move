# FileCopy_Move
Little tool for moving or copying files

This little tool is basically just a tool to copy or move files from A to B.
But instead of just moving around data, the files which are copied from A to B are sorted into folders with the creation-date of the file.

You just need to set a path inside the App.config to start the magic.
NOTE: at the moment the tool can only copy from root, which means you cannot move/copy files from subfolders.
